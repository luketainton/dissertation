% I would like to take this opportunity to pay thanks to my project supervisor, Dalia El-Banna, for her support and guidance throughout the project. I would also like to thank Campbell Elder from Multi-Tech for providing equipment and technical assistance during the testing and build phases of the project. Finally, I would like to thank my family and friends for their support.
