% This section focuses on learning outcome 4 - Critically evaluate the implementation of the artefact and the overall project. \\[0.2cm]
% You should provide an evaluation of the artefact and overall project,. This will express ideas in answer any research question, recognising the limitations of the project and areas for potential development or further work. It must take into consideration appropriate and relevant academic, ethical and professional requirements. \\[0.2cm] 
% There should be a comprehensive discussion comprising interpretation of the findings and substantiated observations and judgements about them. This discussion should include reflection on the issues raised in the project.  Depending on the nature of the project, and particularly with certain business topics for which the main outcomes are recommendations on various management related aspects, the results and discussion chapters may be integrated within chapter(s) of findings covering the relevant project objectives. In this case this chapter could be entitled Recommendations.

Unable to get the modem to work, so information from Multi-Tech was used as a baseline instead. \\\\
Measure packet loss, delay, jitter, etc.
